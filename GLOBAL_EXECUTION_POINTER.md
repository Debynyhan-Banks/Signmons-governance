# Global Execution Pointer

Purpose: single cross-repo index of active work while keeping per-repo boards.

## Canonical Repo Boards

- Governance board:
  - Repo: `signmons-governance`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`
- Backend board:
  - Repo: `signmons-calldesk-backend`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`
- Frontend marketing board:
  - Repo: `signmons-marketing-web-feat-marketing-site`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`

## Current Pointer (as of 2026-09-09)

- Program `Now`: `APP-013` (Twilio-backed notification center and transactional customer messaging)
- Program phase: owner-approved CallDesk-first product execution; `FE-014` is paused, not cancelled
- Sequencing: strict (`Now` -> `Done` before starting `Next`)

- Approved first-pilot scope and acceptance plan: [CALLDESK_MVP_PLAN.md](CALLDESK_MVP_PLAN.md). One approved business, English, online access and human supervision; full platform roadmap deferred, not cancelled. Future milestone order is planning, not automatic ticket promotion.

| Backend | `APP-013` consent/expiry proposal documentation review-ready at abf262cb25f1870e240e15be5e5a0412b698c59a on PR #21; runtime remains aa4c547. Canonical APP013_EMAIL_CONSENT_EXPIRY_PROPOSAL.md is PROPOSED: D1-D4 require explicit owner acceptance/amendment. Docs/placement/link/architecture checks pass; prior runtime/browser/audit results not rerun. No schema, positive eligibility, capture, verification, credentials, queue or sending. Next only after contract approval: bounded consent schema/evidence/job-binding section. Coverage 50%, acceptance 0/12; 7-12 APP-013 / 20-35 pilot unequal sections, low confidence, may grow with verification/retention sizing. No release authority; BE-008 accepted | active |

## Synchronization Rules

- Update this file whenever `Now` changes.
- Per-repo `EXECUTION_BOARD.md` files must agree with this pointer.
- If any repo board diverges, treat as blocker and fix before coding.
