# Global Execution Pointer

Purpose: single cross-repo index of active work while keeping per-repo boards.

## Canonical Repo Boards

- Governance board:
  - Repo: `signmons-governance`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`
- Backend board:
  - Repo: `signmons-calldesk-backend`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`
- Frontend marketing board:
  - Repo: `signmons-marketing-web-feat-marketing-site`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`

## Current Pointer (as of 2026-09-08)

- Program `Now`: `APP-013` (Twilio-backed notification center and transactional customer messaging)
- Program phase: owner-approved CallDesk-first product execution; `FE-014` is paused, not cancelled
- Sequencing: strict (`Now` -> `Done` before starting `Next`)

### Repo Status

| Repo | Active Ticket | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Governance | APP-013 contract and communications-boundary alignment | active |
| Frontend marketing | `FE-014` competitive comparison pages | paused |
| Backend | `APP-013` legacy CREATE messaging safeguard is review-ready on PR #21 at `a8154f74c55a347f1e888e745ee9fe3634eecd6d`; unconfirmed reservations held across admission/capture/recovery/pre-send, retry budgets preserved, backend/UI audits clean; legacy dispatch/technician guards and repair, authorized journal orchestration/recovery ownership, in-flight races and acceptance remain open, no activation or deployment; BE-008 accepted | active |

## Synchronization Rules

- Update this file whenever `Now` changes.
- Per-repo `EXECUTION_BOARD.md` files must agree with this pointer.
- If any repo board diverges, treat as blocker and fix before coding.
