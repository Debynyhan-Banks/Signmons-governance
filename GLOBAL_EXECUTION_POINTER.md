# Global Execution Pointer

Purpose: single cross-repo index of active work while keeping per-repo boards.

## Canonical Repo Boards

- Governance board:
  - Repo: `signmons-governance`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`
- Backend board:
  - Repo: `signmons-calldesk-backend`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`
- Frontend marketing board:
  - Repo: `signmons-marketing-web-feat-marketing-site`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`

## Current Pointer (as of 2026-09-09)

- Program `Now`: `APP-013` (Twilio-backed notification center and transactional customer messaging)
- Program phase: owner-approved CallDesk-first product execution; `FE-014` is paused, not cancelled
- Sequencing: strict (`Now` -> `Done` before starting `Next`)

- Approved first-pilot scope and acceptance plan: [CALLDESK_MVP_PLAN.md](CALLDESK_MVP_PLAN.md). One approved business, English, online access and human supervision; full platform roadmap deferred, not cancelled. Future milestone order is planning, not automatic ticket promotion.

Recording only, not delivery admission. New migration must precede separately approved code release. Next proposed after review: reschedule/cancellation intents with pre-clear window capture, no sending. Scope coverage 50%, acceptance 0/12; pilot allowance 20-35 unequal sections, low confidence, not ETA. BE-008 accepted | active |

## Synchronization Rules

- Update this file whenever `Now` changes.
- Per-repo `EXECUTION_BOARD.md` files must agree with this pointer.
- If any repo board diverges, treat as blocker and fix before coding.
