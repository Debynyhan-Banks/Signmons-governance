# Global Execution Pointer

Purpose: single cross-repo index of active work while keeping per-repo boards.

## Canonical Repo Boards

- Governance board:
  - Repo: `signmons-governance`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`
- Backend board:
  - Repo: `signmons-calldesk-backend`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`
- Frontend marketing board:
  - Repo: `signmons-marketing-web-feat-marketing-site`
  - Board: `EXECUTION_BOARD.md`

## Current Pointer (as of 2026-09-09)

- Program `Now`: `APP-013` (Twilio-backed notification center and transactional customer messaging)
- Program phase: owner-approved CallDesk-first product execution; `FE-014` is paused, not cancelled
- Sequencing: strict (`Now` -> `Done` before starting `Next`)

- Approved first-pilot scope and acceptance plan: [CALLDESK_MVP_PLAN.md](CALLDESK_MVP_PLAN.md). One approved business, English, online access and human supervision; full platform roadmap deferred, not cancelled. Future milestone order is planning, not automatic ticket promotion.

| Backend | `APP-013` reschedule/cancellation email event snapshots review-ready at 949e44896efc5b56263f7199a0eb9e156512d002 on PR #21: immutable pre-clear cancellation claims and exact finalized events; 1190 backend/170 UI tests, 18 local migrations/19 crash cases and browser/four-audit gates pass. Recording only, no delivery admission. Migration-before-code and old/in-flight cancellation compatibility require separate release review. Next proposed after review: inactive event/policy/recipient eligibility with explicit consent/expiry requirements, no credentials or sending. Scope coverage 50%, acceptance 0/12; pilot allowance 20-35 unequal sections, low confidence, not ETA. BE-008 accepted | active |

## Synchronization Rules

- Update this file whenever `Now` changes.
- Per-repo `EXECUTION_BOARD.md` files must agree with this pointer.
- If any repo board diverges, treat as blocker and fix before coding.
